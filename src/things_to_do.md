# Things to do!

1. Write code to take real image and isolate the plate, rotate, and scale as necessary
2. Write code to take theoretical image and scale as necessary
3. Write code to compare the two images

Maybe (probably):

1. Implement "error bars"?
2. Fix model...

SPECIAL NOTE: Buy FLAT white paper to plate plate on so the code can find the contours.
